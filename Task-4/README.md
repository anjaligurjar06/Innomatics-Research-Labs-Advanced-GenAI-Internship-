# Task-4

## Overview

 contains six Python programs that simulate real-world systems such as recharge validation, inventory monitoring, student result processing, fare estimation, attendance tracking, and password strength checking.

The main objective is to practice core Python concepts using simple and clear logic.

## Programs Included

### 1. Mobile Recharge Validation
A recharge validation system that checks:
- Minimum recharge amount
- Valid recharge plans
- Retry option for invalid input

Concepts used:
- Functions
- While loop
- Conditional statements

---

### 2. Inventory Reorder Alert
A stock monitoring system that:
- Checks product quantities
- Prints reorder alert if stock is low

Concepts used:
- Dictionary
- For loop
- Conditions

---

### 3. Student Result Processing
A result system that:
- Accepts list of marks
- Calculates average
- Returns Pass or Fail

Concepts used:
- Loop for total calculation
- Return statement
- Basic arithmetic

---

### 4. Cab Fare Estimator
A fare calculator that:
- Uses base fare and per km rate
- Adds extra charge during peak hour
- Allows retry option

Concepts used:
- Functions
- Percentage calculation
- While loop

---

### 5. Attendance Eligibility Checker
An attendance system that:
- Calculates attendance percentage
- Returns Eligible or Not Eligible

Concepts used:
- Loop for counting
- Percentage formula
- Return statement

---

### 6. Password Strength Checker
A password validation system that:
- Checks minimum length
